# Write code using .each to iterate
# over the students collection.
# NOTE: you will use 'puts' within the block to output
# your return values to the terminal.

students = ["Megan", "Bob", "Mike"]
students.each {|student| puts student}
# your code below



# Once you have your code written out:
# What will the return value be:
# - the first iteration through?
# - the second iteration through?
# - the third iteration through?
