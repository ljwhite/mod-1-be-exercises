# Task # 2

# 1. Update the code above to include an accumulator.
# Naming matters, so name your accumulator descriptively.
# 2. Update line 11 to shovel in `name.capitalize`
# 3. What will we want to change line 14 to so that we return
# our new array with names capitalized?
# 4. Now run it in your terminal.
